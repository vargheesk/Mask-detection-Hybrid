    "# Face Mask Detection System: A Deep Learning Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "In the context of global health crises, automated systems for monitoring public health compliance are vital. This project implements a real-time **Face Mask Detection System** using Computer Vision and Deep Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Architecture\n",
    "The pipeline consists of two distinct stages:\n",
    "1.  **Face Localization**: We use the **Viola-Jones Algorithm** (Haar Cascades) to rapidly identify face regions within an image or video stream. This method is chosen for its high computational efficiency, suitable for CPU-based real-time processing.\n",
    "2.  **Mask Classification**: Detected face regions are passed to a **MobileNetV2** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This model is effectively a binary classifier distinguishing between 'Mask' and 'No Mask' states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Technical Concepts\n",
    "-   **Haar-like Features**: Digital image features used in object recognition.\n",
    "-   **Integral Images**: A data structure allowing specific image features to be computed in constant time $O(1)$.\n",
    "-   **AdaBoost**: A machine learning meta-algorithm that selects the most critical features from a large set.\n",
    "-   **Depthwise Separable Convolutions**: A key component of MobileNetV2 that reduces the number of parameters and computation cost compared to standard convolutions."

   "source": [
    "## 1. Environment Setup & Library Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "We rely on three core libraries:\n",
    "-   **OpenCV (`cv2`)**: An open-source computer vision library. We use it for accessing the camera feed, image manipulation (resizing, color conversion), and utilizing the pre-trained Haar Cascades.\n",
    "-   **TensorFlow/Keras**: The deep learning backend. Keras provides the high-level API to load and run our pre-trained `.h5` model.\n",
    "-   **NumPy**: The backbone of numerical computing in Python. Images are loaded as multi-dimensional NumPy arrays (Height x Width x Channels), allowing us to perform fast matrix operations."

    "\n",
    "Before running the full video pipeline, we load a static sample image (`masked.jpeg`) to verify our data loading and basic processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Image Data\n",
    "-   **Color Spaces**: OpenCV loads images in **BGR** (Blue-Green-Red) format by default, distinct from the standard **RGB** often used in other libraries. This is why you often see `cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)` in visualization code.\n",
    "-   **Array Structure**: The loaded image is a NumPy array. Its shape `(Height, Width, 3)` tells us the resolution and the 3 color channels."

    "We use a **Haar Cascade Classifier** for face detection. This is a machine learning-based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works (The Math)\n",
    "1.  **Haar Features**: The algorithm looks for specific features (like the bridge of the nose being lighter than the eyes). These are effectively contrast checks calculated on rectangular regions.\n",
    "2.  **Integral Image**: To calculate these features rapidly (milliseconds), the algorithm uses an 'Integral Image' representation, which allows calculating the sum of pixels in any rectangle using just 4 array lookups.\n",
    "3.  **Cascading**: Instead of running a complex detector on every window, it runs a series of simple ones. If the first simple check fails (e.g., \"Is there something looking like an eye pair?\"), the region is discarded immediately. This **Attentional Cascade** allows processing the majority of the image (background) extremely quickly."
